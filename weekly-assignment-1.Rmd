# How to set up a GitHub Webpage in R Studio for a macOS! 

## Part 1: Install homebrew 

In order to install homebrew, we will need two things. First, we will need to open our computers terminal. The terminal is how we talk to the computer.   

1. Go to the search bar of your mac and type in terminal 
2. Once the terminal is open check that final text reads yourname$   

**Note:** *To send a command to the computer we will always want to make sure we are typing after yourname$*   

Ex:

Next, we need the code to install homebrew. 

1. Go to this [website](https://brew.sh/)
2. Copy the install homebrew code

Next, return to your terminal with th line of code copied. 

1. Paste the copied code into the terminal after yourname$
2. Hit enter, and wait for the homebrew to download and install. 

**Note:** *Make sure your internet speed not running super slow or the download and installation will take a long time. The download should take ~8 minutes, if it is taking longer, try checking your internet.* 

Once homebrew is installed run ```$ brew install git```. 

**Note:** *If you recieve an error saying the brew function is not found it means something in the installation is likely not complete. Sometimes there will be a few lines of code to copy and paste into the terminal at the end of installation. Just follow the directions your terminal gives you and you should be good!* 

Last, restart R Studio if it was already open!
