### Why Quechee Ski Hill (where I live) is better than it seems

*Some* may say that Quechee ski hill is not a real mountain or is only for beginners, **BUT** having skied there my entire life I can attest that it is well worth the trip for its *crazy* slopes and lovely community. 

Reasons why Quechee is a great ski locale: 

* Good place to learn for beginners 
* There are never any lines
* They never check you for a ticket 
* There is always a happy hour in the lodge at 5 
* Speaking of the lodge the prices are far more inexpensive
* The 12 minute chairlift ride allows for great bonding with your fellow skiers
* A lovely tight knit community
