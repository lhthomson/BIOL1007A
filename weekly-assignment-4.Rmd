##. 1 Simulate a brand new data frame (the type of data is up to you) and conduct a statistical analysis in R using 2 variables. Create a basic ggplot that goes with the analysis.

```{r}
  library(tidyverse)
  #Creating dataframe on made up date about how coffee affects heartrate
  Drink <- c(rep(x = "Water", times = 20), rep( x = "Coffee", times = 20))
  Heartrate <- c(sample(x=40:120, 20), sample(x=40:120, 20))
  HRdata <- data.frame(Drink, Heartrate, stringsAsFactors = F)
  HRdata
  
  #conducting ANOVA test on heartrate data
  test <- aov(Heartrate ~ Drink, data = HRdata)
  testSummary <- summary(test)
  print(testSummary)
  #P value of 0.401 is not significant. 
  
  #creating ggplot
  
 HRgraph <- HRdata %>% 
     ggplot(aes(x=Drink, y=Heartrate)) + 
     geom_boxplot(fill="lightblue", col="black") + 
     xlab("Type of Drink") +
     ylab("Heartrate bpm") + 
     theme_classic()

 print(HRgraph)
  
```
