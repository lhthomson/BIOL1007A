## Question 1: 

```{r}
#Create a vector of consecutive integers from 1 to n_dims2.

n_dims = sample(3:10, 1)
cons_int <- 1:(n_dims)^2

#Use the sample function to randomly reshuffle these values.

rearrange <- sample(cons_int)

#create a square matrix with these elements.

matrixR <- matrix(data = rearrange, nrow = n_dims, ncol = n_dims) 

#print out the matrix.

print(matrixR)

#find a function in r to transpose the matrix.

TmatrixR <- t(matrixR)

#print it out again and note how it has changed.

print(TmatrixR)

#calculate the sum and the mean of the elements in the first row and then the last row.
sum1 <- sum(TmatrixR[,1])
sum2 <- sum(TmatrixR[,n_dims])
mean1 <- mean(TmatrixR[,1])
mean2 <- mean(TmatrixR[,n_dims])

print(sum1)
print(sum2)
print(mean1)
print(mean2)
```
